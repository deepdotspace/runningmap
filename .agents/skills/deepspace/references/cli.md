# CLI catalog, login, and test

## Login contract (`npx deepspace login`)

DeepSpace runs against a hosted platform. Every `npx deepspace` command except scaffolding (`npm create deepspace`) and the no-auth catalog probes (`integrations list`/`info`, `add --list`/`--info`) needs a logged-in account.

**`npx deepspace whoami`** is the canonical login-state probe (add `--json` from agents). It refreshes the JWT in the same call path `dev` / `test` / `deploy` use — if `whoami` succeeds, those will too. On failure: stderr ``Not logged in. Run `deepspace login`.``, exit 1. Don't stat `~/.deepspace/session` — that's a CLI implementation detail.

Four hard rules:

1. **Pause and tell the user.** Login opens a browser tab (GitHub/Google OAuth) on their machine and polls up to 10 minutes. They need to be at the keyboard. There is no agent-runnable bypass — never ask the user for their password.
2. **Run interactive login without an artificial time bound.** **Do not** wrap in `timeout N`, `sleep N && kill`, or any cutoff — those terminate OAuth before completion and leave no session. Run in foreground or a true background process.
3. **After login completes, verify with `npx deepspace whoami`** before retrying `dev` / `test` / `deploy`. Re-running them while login is still polling produces the same error — that's expected order, not a bug.
4. **Login state is shared across all apps on the machine.** One `deepspace login` covers `dev`, `test-accounts`, and `deploy` for any app. Re-login only when `whoami` reports signed-out or expired. **Never copy `.dev.vars` from a sibling app** — `APP_OWNER_JWT` is minted against that app's wrangler name; borrowing causes silent auth mismatches.

## Full command catalog

The happy-path commands (login, `npm create deepspace`, `add`, `dev`, `test`, `deploy`) are in the SKILL. The rest, by lifecycle stage:

```bash
# --- Local dev ---
npx deepspace dev                  # Vite + worker in-process; HMR on localhost:5173, --strictPort fails loudly on clash
npx deepspace dev --port 5180      # parallel apps
npx deepspace dev --prod           # same UI, but workers point at production
npx deepspace kill                 # kill YOUR leaked listener on 5173 + its workerd children (never a sibling session's)
npx deepspace kill --port 5180
npx deepspace kill --all           # sweep every workerd/wrangler/vite on the box

# --- Test accounts (one-time per machine; pool shared across all apps, hard cap of 10) ---
npx deepspace test-accounts list
npx deepspace test-accounts create --email <…@deepspace.test> --password <p> --name <n>

# --- Tests (→ references/testing.md for the real depth) ---
npx deepspace test                 # default suite (smoke + api); auto-installs Playwright + chromium on first run
npx deepspace test e2e             # all Playwright specs
npx deepspace test unit            # vitest
npx deepspace screenshot http://localhost:5173/ out.png [--full-page --wait-for-timeout 500]

# --- Integrations discovery (NO AUTH for list/info; invoke is billed) → references/integrations.md ---
npx deepspace integrations list
npx deepspace integrations info openai/chat-completion
npx deepspace invoke openai/chat-completion --body '{...}'      # AUTH REQUIRED — actually calls, billed to caller
npx deepspace invoke openai/chat-completion --body-file -        # body via stdin

# --- Custom domain (→ references/domain.md) ---
npx deepspace domain search <query>
npx deepspace domain buy <domain>
npx deepspace domain list
npx deepspace domain attach <domain> --app <name>

# --- Publish to the DeepSpace community library ---
npx deepspace library publish [--name "<title>"] [--description "<short>"] [--category <cat>]
npx deepspace library unpublish <handle>

# --- Managed GitHub repos (for users without their own GitHub account) ---
npx deepspace managed-repos list
npx deepspace managed-repos create <app-name>      # platform-owned private repo
npx deepspace managed-repos token <repo-id>        # short-lived clone token
npx deepspace managed-repos delete <repo-id> --yes # per-day quota applies
```

The scaffolder (`npm create deepspace@latest <app-name>`) is non-interactive by default (agent-friendly): omitting `<app-name>` prints usage and exits 1 instead of prompting. Pass `--interactive` / `-i` for the wizard; probe with `--help` / `--version` (plain stdout, no ANSI) before scripting. It scaffolds into a fresh, near-empty, or current dir ("near-empty" = only boilerplate like `.git`, `*.md`, `.dev.vars`); anything else triggers `Directory <name> already exists` and it bails. After scaffold, dependencies install in a detached background process; every subsequent `npx deepspace` command waits on it (gates on `node_modules/deepspace`), so you never need a manual `npm install`.

## Test (`npx deepspace test`)

Tests are the primary way to verify code changes. The scaffolded specs (`smoke.spec.ts` / `api.spec.ts` / `collab.spec.ts`) are starting points — extend them per the Step 8 checklist in `references/testing.md`. The full extension table, debug-from-failures rule, route coverage, multi-user patterns, and the `'deepspace/testing'` fixture all live there.

**One rule that bites first-time runs:** run tests only after a runtime-affecting code change (`src/`, `worker.ts`, etc.). Skip them for conversation, planning, reading, or pure-doc edits — don't run as a ritual. Tests always use dev workers and need provisioned test accounts (see catalog above).

**Deploy mechanics, the `.dev.vars` contract, and secret handling → `references/deploy.md`.**
